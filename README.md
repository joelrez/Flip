# Flip
Flip is a game that I quickly wrote up in Java. I came up with the rules of the game, and it turns out this puzzle idea has already been done in "Between Time: Escape Room."

# How to Play
On the board there will be X's and O's, and by clicking on them, they switch to the other. For instance, if you click an X it will "flip" to an O, and vice versa. In addition, that X or O's adjacent cells will also flip. The objective of the game is to get all O's on the board like below.

The interface has been made so that the user can create their own puzzles by randomly clicking in the grid or allow the algorithm to randomly generate a puzzle. Currently, they are really easy because the algorithm only flips about 10 cells.
